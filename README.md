# Super-Market-Billing-System

* This is the project that is originally done by Rishav Chatterjee (profile link: https://github.com/rishavpiku) under the project https://github.com/rishavpiku/SuperMarket_Billing_Project. I've modified this at my own way and probably this is the easiest one. 

* One important thing to note that if you need to compile it using the "vscode" as I did this whole project doing so, then you need to install first the "minGW" and then extract the .vscode file in the directory where you're actually saving your C++ files, i-e the directory that is opened in the Visaul Studio Code.
